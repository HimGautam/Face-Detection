# Requirements
This code was tested on Python 3.7 with OpenCv 4.5.1.
It can run in any system as long as python and opencv are installed.

# Details
The code uses an object detection algorithm known as **Haar** feature based **Cascade** classifier by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their [paper](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/viola-cvpr-01.pdf).

# Trying it
* Install all the dependencies mentioned above.
* Clone the repository by typing ```$ git clone https://github.com/HimGautam/Face-and-Smile-Detection.git``` in the terminal.
* Run the file by typing ```$ python "smile_detection_trial 1.py"``` in the terminal.

By doing above steps Code will be compiled and a the detection will start.
To stop the detection press ```q```.
